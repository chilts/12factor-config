# 12factor-config #

A config module which only reads the environment. For Node.js that means `process.env`.

Note 1 : We will not ever use `NODE_ENV` in any example here since each environment
should specify everything it needs and nothing should be dependent on being a particular
environment (such as 'development', 'testing', 'staging' or 'production').

Note 2 : This package is considered stable so the fact that there are few commits these
days is no sign of inactivity, just stability. Please use and submit PRs for bugs. New
features will be considered too.

## Stability ##

Please note that this project is pretty much feature complete. Issues will be fixed. New
features may be added if necessary. Otherwise it won't have very many more releases - but
rest assured I will support it and you. The project is not dead, it is merely resting.

## Synopsis ##

Firstly, set some environment variables that your program will look for. You don't need
to set any that have a 'default' but you do need to set any that are 'required'.

```bash
$ export REDIS_URL=redis://user:password@hostname:port/db
$ export APPNAME_PORT=8080
```

Then, in your program:

```javascript
var config = require('12factor-config');

var cfg = config({
    redisUrl : {
        env      : 'REDIS_URL',
        type     : 'string', // default
        required : true,
    },
    logfile : {
        env      : 'APPNAME_LOG_FILE',
        type     : 'string',
        default  : '/var/log/appname.log',
        required : true,
    },
    port : {
        env      : 'APPNAME_PORT',
        type     : 'integer',
        default  : '8000',
        required : true,
    },
    debug : {
        env      : 'APPNAME_DEBUG',
        type     : 'boolean',
        default  : 'false',
    },
    env : {
        // you really shouldn't use this, but some people/packages do
        env      : 'NODE_ENV',
        type     : 'enum',
        values   : [ 'development', 'test', 'stage', 'production', ],
    },
});

console.log(cfg);
```

Should output something like:

```
{
  redisUrl: 'redis://user:password@hostname:port/db',
  logfile: '/var/log/appname.log',
  port: 8080,
  debug: false,
  env: 'development'
}
```

It is advisable to prefix your environment variables with a prefix related to your application
name as shown in the later config vars above. Mainly this is to namespace your vars and not stomp
over others already defined. Of course you don't need to use the prefix in the local name.

## Valid Values ##

When you have certain types, some transformations are performed to get it from a string (since the
environment only contains string) into the required value.

* `boolean` - upper or lower case is allowed
    * true - 'true', 't', 'yes', 'y', 'on', '1'
    * false - 'false', 'f', 'no', 'n', 'off', '0'
    * any other value throws

## What I Do ##

I usually have a `lib/cfg.js` such as the following:

```javascript
var config = require('12factor-config');

var cfg = config({
    // ... environment config here ...
});

module.exports = cfg;
```

By doing this, all other files in your application can just `require('lib/cfg.js')` and obtain
the exact same configuration.
